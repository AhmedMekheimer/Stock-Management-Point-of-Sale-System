# Stock Management & POS System

This web application targets a clothing retail store franchise. The franchinse manager is able to manage the store's branches, clothing items and their variants. Clothing items can be bought from suppliers and added to a branch through Receive Orders and each branch has its point of sale to sell the items to retail customers through sales invoices. Lastly, the system has role-based access control, meaning roles can be created to give each user certain priviliges.
